# Minesweeper

It's left click to reveal a tile and right click to flag one. You win once you flag all and only the mines correctly or by clearing everything apart from the mines.

You can also click on a revealed tile and if it has to correct number of flags around it, it will clear everything else around it.

If you've never played the game before the goal is to figure out where all the mines are but not hit them. When you reveal a tile it will have a number on it (or it will be blank which means the number is 0), this number represents how many mines there are in the adjacent tiles (including diagonals). You can use this information to figure out where all the mines are. You're unlikely to come across a scenario where you have to make a random guess unless the mine density is greater than about 0.2. 

The "Mines Left" up the top is a useful tool near the end of the game when there aren't many unrevealed tiles left, not that the number displayed is the total mines minus your flags placed so if any of your flags are wrong, this number will be wrong.
